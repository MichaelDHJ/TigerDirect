Learning Path Stones

Phonics Skills 
Before they can read independently, children must learn the relationship of letters to their sounds and be able to distinguish individual sounds, or phonemes, within words. Phonics skills help children sounds out new words (If I can read ""pot"", then I can read ""hot"" and ""spot"").
The Alphabet 
Knowing the letters of the alphabet is one of the first steps toward learning to read and write. Introducing letters to young children helps them learn to recognize the different shapes and names - an early indicator for reading achievement.
Keyboarding 
Learning to use the keyboard is another step in becoming computer literate. It can take a while for children to learn the positioning of each key, but simply searching for the right key helps children with letter recognition. Eventually, they'll be able to use the keyboard commands as an alternative to using the mouse.
Mousing 
Children start off using the computer mouse before they learn how to use the keys. It's best to get a child-sized mouse so that it's small enough for children to handle correctly. Within a short space of time children become adept at navigating the screen using the mouse to point and click.
Screen Navigation 
Children quickly learn the basics of screen navigation. By pointing and clicking they can open programs they can use to help them learn.
Money 
It's important for children to learn about money and money management from an early age. Children first identify individual coins, and then identify thier values, and then find values of groups of coins.
Number Recognition 
To begin their study of math, children must distinguish numerals from letters and shapes and understand that numbers are symbols for amounts.","Phonic Skills, Keyboarding, Mousing, Ages 3-6","","","","","","","","","11.0000","0.0000","1","0","0","1","1.0000","1","0.0000","1","1","","0.0000","1","0","1","0","1","0.0000","1","0","0","0","1","LeapFrog 22659 ClickStart Scout's Puppy Pals Game","0","simple","",""
